# Title

## 1. Executive Summary
- **What happened:** (one paragraph)
- **Why it matters:** (risk in plain language)
- **High-level fix:** (one sentence)

## 2. Scope & Assumptions (ROE)
- Authorized lab/training environment only.
- Identifiers sanitized (`TARGET_IP`, `USER_A`, `SERVICE_X`).

## 3. Attack Surface (Observed)
