# ROOM_TITLE

## Executive Summary

- **Objective:** What the lab, room, or exercise is designed to teach.
- **Core finding:** The main security issue or defensive insight.
- **Security impact:** What an attacker or defender can realistically gain or lose.
- **Primary remediation:** The most important fix or control.

## Scope and Sanitization

- Authorized lab or training target only.
- Replace live identifiers with canonical placeholders such as `TARGET_IP`, `TARGET_HOST`, `TARGET_URL`, `USER_A`, and `API_KEY_REDACTED`.
- Follow [docs/placeholder-policy.md](/D:/OneDrive/2%20/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-policy.md) and validate materially edited public notes with `python scripts/check_placeholders.py <changed files>`.
- Exclude secrets, full exploit chains, and customer-specific data.
- Publish reasoning, decision points, and defensive takeaways instead of raw command spam.

## Attack Surface

- Entry points observed:
- Trust boundaries:
- Signals worth testing:
- Constraints that shaped the approach:

## Finding 1: TITLE

- **Category:** Vulnerability class or detection theme.
- **Affected component:** Endpoint, service, route, parser, workflow, or trust boundary.
- **Root cause:** Why the weakness exists.
- **Exploitation logic:** High-level reasoning, not a weaponized recipe.
- **Impact:** Confidentiality, integrity, availability, or detection impact.
- **Remediation:** Concrete engineering fix.
- **Detection ideas:** Logs, alerts, telemetry pivots, and control points.
- **Generalizable lesson:** What to reuse elsewhere.

## Method and Decision Notes

- Why this path was tested:
- What was ruled out:
- What evidence changed the hypothesis:
- What should stay private or unpublished:

## Evidence

- Screenshots or artifacts kept under `assets/`.
- Sanitize usernames, tokens, domains, hostnames, and IP addresses before publishing.
- Prefer short narrative evidence summaries over raw dumps.

## Detection and Defensive Notes

- Preventive controls:
- Detective controls:
- Hardening opportunities:
- Residual risk:

## Takeaways

- Reusable pattern:
- Mistake to avoid next time:
- Reference worth re-reading:

## References

- Vendor documentation
- Standards, ATT&CK, OWASP, NVD, or protocol references
- Official lab page if publication rules allow it
