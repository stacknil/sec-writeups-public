# Placeholder Policy Expansion

Date: 2026-03-24

## Summary

This review checked the current placeholder governance state against:

* [docs/placeholder-policy.md](/D:/OneDrive/2/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-policy.md)
* [docs/placeholder-execution-backlog.md](/D:/OneDrive/2/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-execution-backlog.md)
* [docs/placeholder-false-positive-triage.md](/D:/OneDrive/2/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-false-positive-triage.md)

Result:

* There are **no remaining active-note cases** currently classified as `add to policy`.
* The previously open policy-gap cases were already resolved in the 2026-03-19 policy pass.
* No new canonical placeholder additions are proposed in this document.
* No new exemption rules are proposed in this document.

## Reviewed "Add To Policy" Cases

Current triage state:

* [docs/placeholder-false-positive-triage.md](/D:/OneDrive/2/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-false-positive-triage.md) explicitly states: "No remaining active-note cases are currently classified as `add to policy`."
* [docs/placeholder-execution-backlog.md](/D:/OneDrive/2/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-execution-backlog.md) still retains some historical ambiguity notes for auditability, but those are no longer the active classification source for policy expansion.

Because there are no remaining `add to policy` cases, there is nothing in this pass to convert into either:

* a new canonical semantic placeholder
* a new explicit exempt literal

## Proposed Canonical Additions

None.

The last material policy-expansion items were already incorporated into
[docs/placeholder-policy.md](/D:/OneDrive/2/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-policy.md):

* `ADMIN_IP`
* `GATEWAY_MAC`
* `MAC_A`
* `MAC_B`
* `MAC_C`
* `MAC_R`
* `VALUE_REDACTED`
* `SAME_HASH_VALUE`

These are already part of the canonical policy and therefore are not remaining expansion candidates.

## Proposed Exemptions

None.

The current exemption track is already captured in
[docs/placeholder-false-positive-triage.md](/D:/OneDrive/2/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-false-positive-triage.md)
and reflected in
[docs/placeholder-policy.md](/D:/OneDrive/2/10%20Projects/p-sec-write-ups/docs/placeholder-policy.md)
under "Literal Identifiers That Should Stay Literal."

## Still Too Ambiguous And Intentionally Deferred

None in the active `add to policy` queue.

Any remaining placeholder-related work is currently categorized elsewhere:

* `normalize` cases with an existing canonical landing spot
* `false positive / exempt literal` cases that should be handled in checker/exemption work

If future audit passes discover genuinely new semantic families that cannot land in the current policy, they should be added to the triage doc first and only then brought back into a policy-expansion pass.
