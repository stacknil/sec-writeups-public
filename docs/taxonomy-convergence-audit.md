# Taxonomy Convergence Audit

Date: 2026-03-18

## Summary

No drift detected. Active-note front matter aligns with `schemas/taxonomy.json`, and `TryHackMe/_meta/TAGS.md` is fully derived from the current taxonomy.

## Checks Run

* `python scripts/check_markdown.py`
* `python scripts/render_tags_doc.py --check`

## Findings

* Active-note front matter: no schema violations, unknown taxonomy values, or alias usage reported.
* `TryHackMe/_meta/TAGS.md`: up to date with `schemas/taxonomy.json`.
* Deprecated-value usage: none detected by the checks above.

## Notes

This audit relies on the repository's built-in validation scripts for front matter taxonomy conformance and TAGS rendering parity. No files were modified beyond this report.
