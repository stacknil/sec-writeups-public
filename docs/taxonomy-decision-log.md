# Taxonomy Decision Log

## Scope

- Source reviewed: `docs/taxonomy-normalization-plan.md`.
- Scope of this log: every value previously marked `review-needed` in that plan.
- These are proposed decisions only. No note bodies or front matter are changed by this document.
- Decision meanings: `merge-to-existing` collapses to an already-established canonical value, `promote-into-taxonomy` keeps the value as a first-class canonical term, and `drop-as-noise` removes it from future taxonomy use.

## Research And Learning Meta

- Decision split: `1` promote, `0` merge, `3` drop.
- Values are ordered by frequency first, then alphabetically within the same frequency band.

| Field | Value | Count | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `skills` | `learning-roadmap` | 1 | `drop-as-noise` | Useful in prose, but too meta to function as stable front matter taxonomy. |
| `skills` | `research` | 1 | `drop-as-noise` | Too generic to separate one note from another in a helpful way. |
| `skills` | `role-mapping` | 1 | `drop-as-noise` | Career/learning framing is better kept in prose than as taxonomy. |
| `skills` | `source-evaluation` | 1 | `promote-into-taxonomy` | Quality-evaluation of sources is a distinct research skill worth preserving. |
