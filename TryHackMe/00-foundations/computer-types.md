## 0) Summary

* Computers are not defined by having a screen/keyboard; many are “hidden” inside everyday objects.
* Different computer types exist because design is a trade-off: mobility vs cooling/performance; reliability vs cost; purpose shapes interface and architecture.
* Key taxonomy covered: Laptop, Desktop, Workstation, Server, Smartphone, Tablet, IoT device, Embedded computer.
* A practical rule: *There is no best computer; only the right tool for the job.*

## 1) Key Concepts

### 1.1 Computers you sit in front of

| Computer type | Screen/keyboard | Main purpose                                   |
| ------------- | --------------: | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Laptop        |             Yes | Portable everyday computing                    |
| Desktop       |             Yes | Sustained performance at a fixed location      |
| Workstation   |             Yes | Precision + reliability for professional tasks |
| Server        |              No | Provide services to many users over a network  |

Core intuition:

* Laptop: portable → tight space and thermal constraints → struggles under sustained load.
* Desktop: stationary + wall power + better cooling → can sustain performance longer.
* Workstation: desktop-like form factor, but optimized for accuracy/reliability under long/complex tasks.
* Server: runs continuously, serves multiple users; often operated indirectly (you consume its services).

### 1.2 Computers you don’t “sit in front of”

| Type              | What it is                                                      | Examples                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Smartphone        | Pocket-sized computer optimized for battery life + connectivity | iPhone, Android phone                                            |
| Tablet            | Touch-first computer with larger screen                         | iPad, drawing tablet                                             |
| IoT device        | Network-connected device with a single purpose                  | Thermostat, smart doorbell, fitness tracker                      |
| Embedded computer | Computer built into another device                              | Coffee maker controller, automatic door sensor, lamp dimmer chip |

IoT vs Embedded (quick discriminator):

* IoT device: *connectivity is central* (reports data / receives commands over a network).
* Embedded computer: *may have no network*; does a job inside a machine for years, often unnoticed.

### 1.3 Why different “flavors” exist

* Mobility costs power: small portable computers sacrifice sustained performance.
* Reliability costs money: critical systems use redundancy (extra power supplies/disks) to reduce failure.
* Purpose shapes everything: phones are interacted with directly; servers are queried for services; embedded systems operate quietly.

## 2) Walkthrough Notes by Task (based on provided screenshots)

### Task 1 — Sophia’s First Day (Hidden computers)

Goal: find all hidden computers with limited mistakes.
Found set (8/8):

* Smart TV
* Robot Vacuum
* Smartwatch
* Smart Fridge
* Smart Speaker
* Security Cam
* WiFi Router
* Thermostat

Takeaway: “computer” includes any device with compute + control logic, not just PCs.

### Task 2 — The Hot Laptop (Cooling constraints)

Observation:

* Laptop cooling components shown: **Tiny Fan**, **Heat Pipes**, **Heat Sink** → “limited by thin design”.
* Desktop: “more space = better cooling = sustained performance”.
  Results:
* Laptop: **throttles under load**.
* Desktop: **sustained performance**.

### Task 3 — The Server Room (Redundancy)

Scenario: servers run 24/7; test power configurations.
Key message: “Redundant power reduces a single failure point.”
Note: uptime improves when redundancy is combined with backups and monitoring.

### Task 4 — The Right Tool (Match job → computer type)

Matched jobs (3/3):

* Edit 4K video all day → **Workstation**
* Host a website 24/7 → **Server**
* Ring when button pressed → **Embedded**

### Task 5 — Graduation Quiz (answers from screenshots)

1. Why do laptops throttle more than desktops?

* **Less cooling space**

2. What does server redundancy prevent?

* **Single point of failure**

3. Why do smartphones last longer on battery than laptops?

* **Optimized for efficiency**

4. Which feature is more common in workstations?

* **ECC RAM and certified drivers**

## 3) Pattern Cards (generalizable)

* Trade-off lens (Design Trade-offs / 设计权衡): portability ↔ cooling ↔ sustained performance.
* Reliability engineering (Reliability / 可靠性): redundancy reduces SPOF (Single Point of Failure / 单点故障).
* Taxonomy heuristic: if a device is single-purpose *and* network-connected → likely IoT; if single-purpose but offline → likely embedded.
* Selection rule: choose by workload + uptime requirement + interaction model, not by appearance.

## 5) Takeaways

* “Computer” is a role (compute/control) rather than a shape (screen/keyboard).
* Sustained workloads expose thermal design limits; desktops win when time-under-load matters.
* Servers prioritize availability; redundancy targets failure modes rather than speed.
* Workstations emphasize correctness and stability for professional tasks.

## 6) CN–EN Glossary

* throttle（降频/限频）：reduce performance to control heat/power.
* sustained performance（持续性能）：maintain performance under long load.
* redundancy（冗余）：extra components to tolerate failures.
* single point of failure, SPOF（单点故障）：one component failure breaks the whole system.
* embedded computer/system（嵌入式计算/系统）：computer built into another device.
* IoT device（物联网设备）：network-connected single-purpose device.
