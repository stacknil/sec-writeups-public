## 0) Summary

* Malware history is tightly coupled with how computers started to **share resources over networks** (resource sharing) and later how microcomputers spread software via **removable media** (floppy disks).
* Early “malware-like” programs often looked like **experiments** in mobility or replication (e.g., Creeper), but they revealed real operational risks: uncontrolled replication → **resource exhaustion** and denial of service.
* A recurring pattern: **capability first, harm later**. Techniques such as self-replication, remote execution, and obfuscation/encryption started as mechanisms, then became weaponized.

## CN–EN Glossary

* malicious software (恶意软件)
* worm (蠕虫)
* virus (病毒)
* Trojan (木马)
* packet switching (分组交换)
* denial of service, DoS (拒绝服务)
* fork bomb (分叉炸弹)
* boot sector virus (引导扇区病毒)
* obfuscation/encryption for stealth (为隐蔽而做的混淆/加密)

## 1) Key Concepts

### 1.1 Self-replicating programs

John von Neumann proposed a foundational theory/design for **self-replicating computer programs** (a conceptual ancestor of “computer viruses”). The important part is the idea: programs can be designed to replicate, and that replication can be automated.

### 1.2 Packet switching as an enabler

Packet switching means splitting data into packets, sending them over a network, and reassembling them at the receiver. This makes large-scale networking practical and also creates an efficient channel for programs to move.

A simple mental model:

```
[Data/File] -> [Packets] -> (Network routes) -> [Packets] -> [Reassembled Data/File]
```

## 2) Timeline Notes (Task-by-Task)

### 2.1 Creeper (1971)

Context:

* Often described as the first “virus/worm-like” program.
* Written by **Bob Thomas**.
* Moved across **ARPANET** between computers.
* Implemented in **PDP-10 Assembly** on **TENEX**.

Behavior:

* Displayed a repeating message on teletype screens:

  * “I’m the creeper, catch me if you can!”
* It removed older copies of itself before moving (a primitive form of self-limiting replication).

Important nuance:

* Because it caused no deliberate harm, it is sometimes framed as “not technically malware,” but it clearly demonstrates network-propagating code.

Key Q/A anchors:

* Re-designed by: **Ray Tomlinson**
* Printed text: **“I’m the creeper, catch me if you can!”**

### 2.2 ARPANET basics

* “ARPANET” stands for **Advanced Research Projects Agency Network**.
* Early ARPANET emphasized **remote login** and **file transfer**.
* The Network Working Group created the **Network Control Program (NCP)**.
* Data transfer model: **packet switching**.

### 2.3 Reaper

Context:

* Created after Creeper.
* Purpose: remove Creeper wherever found (early “anti-malware” intent).
* Credited to **Ray Tomlinson**.

Notes:

* Sometimes described as a “nematode” (malware that removes other malware), but that term appears niche; the key point is functional: Reaper acted as an early **anti-virus-like** cleanup program.

Key Q/A anchors:

* Created by: **Ray Tomlinson**
* Main project (Bob Thomas): develop a **resource-sharing capability** (RSEXEC).
* API: **Application Programming Interface**.

### 2.4 Wabbit / Rabbit (1974)

Context:

* One of the first clearly malicious self-replicators.
* Replicated aggressively on the same machine (not a network worm).

Mechanism:

* Creates an infinite loop spawning processes/copies, consuming CPU cycles and OS resources until the system slows/crashes.

Modern framing:

* Similar to a **Denial-of-Service (DoS)** via a **fork bomb**.

Key Q/A anchors:

* Modern-day “fork bomb” also known as: **Denial-of-Service attack**
* Name derived from: Elmer Fudd’s pronunciation of “Rabbit” (“Wabbit”).

### 2.5 ANIMAL + PERVADE (1975)

Context:

* Early Trojan-like behavior: a game that hides a replicating component.
* ANIMAL: a question game that guesses the animal you think of.
* PERVADE: a subroutine that copies itself and ANIMAL into directories the user can access.

Trojan analogy:

* Trojan horse story: a benign-looking “gift” hides hostile intent; similarly, a Trojan program looks friendly while doing something else.

Operational detail:

* It attempted to copy safely (avoiding damage) using file status tables.
* An OS upgrade changed formats, breaking safe-copy logic and halting spread.

Key Q/A anchors:

* PERVADE added in: **1975**
* Spread across: **UNIVACs**
* Malware type: **Trojan**
* Wooden horse built by: **Greeks**

### 2.6 Elk Cloner (1982)

Context:

* Written by **Richard Skrenta** (age 15), initially as a prank.
* Spread “in the wild” via **floppy disks** on Apple II systems.

Technique:

* A classic **boot sector virus** pattern: infection persists via boot media and replicates to other disks.

Activation:

* Triggered on the 50th time the infected game was run.

Impact:

* Caused accidental harm by overwriting reserved tracks on Apple DOS disks.

Key Q/A anchors:

* Affected OS: **Apple II (Apple DOS)**
* More/less common today: **less common**
* Development time: **2 weeks**

### 2.7 The Morris Internet Worm (1988)

Context:

* Created by **Robert Tappan Morris**.
* Intended to demonstrate security flaws on academic networks.

Failure mode:

* Didn’t reliably check if a host was already infected → repeated reinfection → resource exhaustion.

Spread vectors:

* Exploited vulnerabilities in Unix **Sendmail**, **rsh/rexec**, and weak passwords.

Scale (as described in the room):

* Infected ~2000 computers within 15 hours; later reports mention ~6000 total (about 10% of the internet at the time).

Legal milestone:

* First felony conviction under the US **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (1986)**.

Key Q/A anchors:

* Big access method: **Berkeley r-commands** (including rsh)
* rsh meaning: **remote shell**
* Fork bomb is a type of: **Denial-of-Service**

### 2.8 Cascade

What made it notable:

* Early use of **encryption/obfuscation** primarily for stealth (avoid detection), not for encrypting user data.
* Targeted executable **.COM** files (DOS-era).

Indicators of compromise (IoC-style thinking):

* File size growth (commonly +1704 bytes in many variants).
* Possible mutations leading to bugs (e.g., re-infecting the same file multiple times).
* Payload window (Oct 1–Dec 31) where text “falls” down the screen in some variants.

Other notes:

* Attempted to avoid infecting IBM systems via string checks, but bugs undermined this.

Key Q/A anchors:

* Virus name: **Cascade**
* File extension infected: **.COM**
* OS: **DOS**
* Added bytes (typical): **1704**

## 3) Pattern Cards (transferable mental models)

### Pattern 1: Uncontrolled replication → DoS

If a replicating program doesn’t track where it has been (or limit reproduction), replication becomes an availability attack.

### Pattern 2: “Useful” mechanism → adversarial reuse

* Remote execution (rsh/rexec), resource sharing (RSEXEC), and boot mechanisms are operational conveniences.
* The same mechanisms become propagation vectors when combined with exploitation and weak authentication.

### Pattern 3: Stealth via encoding

Encryption/obfuscation can be used defensively (privacy) or offensively (avoid detection). Cascade is an early example of the latter.
