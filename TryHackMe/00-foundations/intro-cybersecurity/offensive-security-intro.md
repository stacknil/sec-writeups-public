# Offensive Security Intro – Lab Notes

- **Type:** Guided web exploitation lab  
- **Focus:** Offensive Security / Web Hacking Basics / Directory Brute Force  
- **Lab context:** TryHackMe “FakeBank” training room (simulated target)

## 1. What is Offensive Security?

Offensive security is about **thinking and acting like an attacker** in a controlled, legal setting.

Typical activities include:

- Breaking into computer systems and web applications.  
- Exploiting software bugs and misconfigurations.  
- Finding hidden functionality and logic flaws that lead to unauthorised access.

The goal is **not** chaos. The goal is:

> Understand how real attackers operate → fix the weaknesses → improve overall defence.

This mindset is used in:

- Penetration testing  
- Red teaming  
- Adversary emulation  
- Security research / bug bounty

## 2. FakeBank Scenario – Your First Legal “Hack”

In this lab, the target is a **fake online banking application** called `FakeBank`.  
You are given:

- A normal user account in the system.  
- A fully isolated virtual machine where attacking the site is allowed.

Objective of the exercise:

- Start as a regular user.  
- Discover hidden functionality.  
- Abuse it to add money to your own account.

This is a classic “broken access control / hidden feature” scenario in web security.

## 3. Discovering Hidden Functionality with `dirb`

### 3.1 Idea

Many web applications expose sensitive features on **“secret” URLs**:

- `/admin`, `/manage`, `/backup`, `/test`, etc.  
- Developers assume “nobody will guess this path”, which is obviously wrong.

A common offensive technique is **directory brute forcing**:

- Take a wordlist of common names (e.g. `admin`, `login`, `bank-deposit`).  
- For each word, send an HTTP request and check if the path exists.  
- Tools: `dirb`, `dirbuster`, `ffuf`, `gobuster`, …

### 3.2 Running `dirb` Against FakeBank

Basic usage in the lab:

```bash
dirb http://fakebank.thm
```
Key observations:

   - `dirb` uses a wordlist such as `common.txt` to generate candidate paths.

   - Lines starting with `+` in the output indicate paths that actually exist.

In this room, `dirb` discovers two interesting URLs, including:

   - `http://fakebank.thm/images` – static resources

   - `http://fakebank.thm/bank-deposit` – **hidden deposit page** (sensitive function)

The second one is the real target.

## 4. Abusing the Hidden Deposit Page

Once the hidden page `/bank-deposit` is found:

  1. Open `http://fakebank.thm/bank-deposit` in the browser.

  2. The page allows adding funds to any bank account number.

  3. You know your own account ID from the previous task (e.g. `8881`).

  4. Enter your account number and deposit amount (e.g. `2000`).

This is a textbook example of **missing access control**:

  - The application exposes a powerful operation (add funds).

  - It does not verify whether the user is authorised to perform it.

  - There is no server-side check like “only staff accounts may access this page”.

After submitting the form, your account balance becomes positive and the site shows a success popup (plus a small “flag” for the room).

## 5. Key Takeaways from This Lab

**1. Security-by-obscurity fails.**

  - Hiding a function behind a secret URL is not real security.

  - Directory brute-force tools will eventually find it.

**2. Every sensitive action needs proper access control.**

  - Operations that move money, change passwords, or modify data must be restricted and checked on the server side.

  - The client (browser) must never be trusted to enforce rules.

**3. Wordlists encode common developer habits.**

  - Many people name pages with predictable words: `admin`, `backup`, `test`, `deposit`, etc.

  - Wordlists like `common.txt` are basically “crowdsourced intuition” of what humans tend to choose.

**4. Offensive labs are safe sandboxes.**

  - You are allowed to break things inside the provided VM.

  - The same techniques are illegal against real systems without explicit permission.

## 6. Checklist: Basic Web Discovery Attack Flow

Minimal mental model you can reuse for future labs:
- Identify target URL or domain.
- Run a directory brute-force scan (e.g. `dirb`, `ffuf`) with a reasonable wordlist.
- Review discovered paths:
  - Static content? (`/images`, `/css`) → usually low impact.
  - Dynamic or sensitive actions? (`/admin`, `/deposit`, `/backup`) → investigate further.
- Open promising paths in the browser and test:
  - What functionality do they expose?
  - Is authentication required?
  - Is authorisation enforced correctly?
- Check if you can perform actions you should not be allowed to do (e.g. add money, view other users’ data).
- Document the issue clearly: **impact, steps to reproduce, and suggested fix**.
