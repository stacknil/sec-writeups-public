# BFFs – Getting Started: Inspecting the Site

> Scenario: pre‑production social media app **BFFs**. Goal is to pivot from a normal user-facing page to the hidden admin portal using only the browser and very light OSINT‑style recon.

---

## 1. First contact – eyeballing the site

**Target URL**
`http://<THM_IP>/`

Actions:

* Open the site in Firefox from the TryHackMe attack box.
* Take note of:

  * Page title and branding ("BFFs")
  * Any mention of “admin”, “beta”, “test”, or “coming soon”.
* Confirm that we’re looking at a typical social media / profile site with no obvious **Admin** link in the visible UI.

**Why this matters:**
Before touching tools like Burp, we treat the browser itself as a recon tool. Many CTF‑style misconfigurations are literally visible if you just look carefully.

---

## 2. Inspecting the HTML source – hunting for comments

### 2.1 Opening the source

From the main page:

* Right‑click → **View Page Source** (or press `Ctrl+U`).
* Firefox opens a new tab containing the raw HTML.

### 2.2 Searching for developer comments

In the source tab:

* Use `Ctrl+F` and search for `<!--` to jump between HTML comments.
* Manually skim anything that looks like a TODO, note, or commented‑out link.

Typical patterns:

* `<!-- TODO: remove /test-admin before production -->`
* `<!-- Debug login at /admin-portal -->`

Once we see something like `/test-admin`, we treat it as a **high‑value endpoint leak**.

### 2.3 Following the leaked endpoint

* Navigate directly to the discovered path, e.g.

  * `http://<THM_IP>/test-admin`
* Confirm that this reveals an **Admin Page** with a login form.

**Takeaway:**
HTML comments are not access control. Any information in them should be treated as public. In real applications this often includes:

* Internal endpoints or feature toggles
* Temporary debug admin panels
* Hard‑coded usernames / emails

## 3. Hidden admin login – understanding the risk

At `/test-admin` we see:

* A heading like **Admin Page!**
* A note such as: *"Admin page to manage other users before we go live. Should be removed after moving into production"*.
* A simple form with fields:

  * **Username**
  * **Password**

Why this is dangerous:

* Admin interfaces are usually **high‑impact**:

  * View or edit all users and posts
  * Delete accounts
  * Change site‑wide settings
* Even a single weak control (e.g., default credentials) can compromise the whole application.

Before brute forcing, we try the **lowest‑hanging fruit**: default or guessable credentials.

---

## 4. Default credential guessing

### 4.1 Why default creds are a thing

Many frameworks ship with preset admin accounts to simplify development. In a rushed deployment, devs may:

* Forget to rotate these credentials, or
* Keep a “temporary” test admin page online.

In CTFs and in real incidents, logging in with the defaults is often enough to fully compromise the app.

### 4.2 Typical username:password pairs to try

Manually test combinations in the login form (a few examples):

* `admin:admin`
* `admin:password`
* `administrator:password123`
* `root:root`

In this room, one of the common default pairs works and grants access to the **admin portal**.

We always:

* Keep a small mental (or written) wordlist of likely defaults.
* Try only a **handful** of guesses to avoid noisy brute force.

---

## 5. Inside the admin portal – what can we see/do?

After successful login, the `/admin-portal` reveals:

* **Admin profile section**

  * Name, status, location fields (editable).
* **Feed / posts management**

  * Admin’s own post visible, with metadata such as timestamp and author.
* **User management section**

  * A list of signed‑up users (e.g., `peterpan`, `asmith`, `jane`).
  * Links like `[delete]` next to each user.

This gives the admin the ability to:

* View sensitive user data (usernames and potentially more PII if exposed elsewhere).
* Delete arbitrary user accounts.
* Potentially pivot to further functionality (e.g., role changes, password resets) if implemented.

From an attacker’s perspective, this is a **full privilege escalation** from anonymous visitor to site administrator.

## 6. Mini diagram – attacker workflow

```text
[Browser] --> [Public BFFs page]
      |              |
      |  View Source |
      v              v
   Find HTML comment leaking "/test-admin"
      |
      v
[Browser] --> GET /test-admin  (hidden admin login)
      |
      |  Try default creds
      v
[Browser] --> POST /test-admin (valid admin credentials)
      |
      v
      /admin-portal  (full admin control over users)
```

## 7. Defensive lessons

1. **Never rely on obscurity:**

   * Hidden URLs, test pages, and HTML comments are not access controls.

2. **Remove test/admin interfaces before production:**

   * Anything labelled “should be removed in production” usually becomes the first foothold.

3. **Rotate or disable default accounts:**

   * Change default passwords on deployment.
   * Prefer creating unique admin users per environment.

4. **Limit admin surface area:**

   * Protect admin portals with:

     * Strong, unique credentials
     * Multi‑factor authentication (MFA)
     * IP allow‑listing or VPN‑only access where possible

5. **Monitor for suspicious logins:**

   * Alert on logins from unknown IPs
   * Alert on repeated failed login attempts
