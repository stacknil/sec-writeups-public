## 1. What Is a Network?

In everyday life, a **network** is simply “things that are connected”:

- A public transportation system  
- The national power grid  
- Postal services  
- A social circle of friends

In computing, the idea is the same, but the “things” are **devices**:

- Laptops, phones, servers  
- Cameras, traffic lights, industrial controllers  
- Even sensors in agriculture, smart homes, etc.

> A computer network = two or more devices connected so they can exchange data.

Networks vary in size from 2 devices on a home Wi-Fi to billions of devices across the globe.  
Because networks are now embedded in almost everything, **basic networking is foundational for cyber security**.

## 2. What Is the Internet?

The Internet is:

> “A network of networks” – one huge global network made up of many smaller networks.

Analogy:

- Alice, Bob, Jim form one small network (they all talk directly).  
- Alice also knows Zayn and Toby and can speak their language.  
- Alice acts as a **bridge**, connecting two smaller groups into a bigger network.

In computing terms:

- Small, internal networks are usually **private networks**.  
- The connections between them, visible to the world, form the **public network** (the Internet).

So any given network is typically one of:

1. **Private network** – e.g. your home LAN, office network.  
2. **Public network** – the larger Internet that connects many private networks.

## 3. Identifying Devices: IP and MAC

Like humans having both **names** and **fingerprints**, devices also have two identifiers:

1. **IP address** – logical address, can change over time.  
2. **MAC address** – hardware address of the network interface, meant to be unique.

### 3.1 IP Addresses

An IPv4 address looks like:

```text
192.168.1.254
```
  - 4 groups (“octets”), each 0–255.

  - Together they identify a device on a network **for some period of time**.

  - Within a single network, the same IP cannot be active on two devices at once.

There are two main categories:

  - **Private IP address** – used **inside** a local network.

    - Example: `192.168.1.77` and `192.168.1.74` on the same home LAN.

  - **Public IP address** – used on the Internet, assigned by your ISP.

    - Multiple devices in the same home can share a single public IP via NAT.

Because IPv4 only supports about 4.29 billion addresses (2³²), we are hitting limits.
**IPv6** is the newer scheme:

  - Uses 128-bit addresses (2¹²⁸ possibilities).

  - Provides essentially “enough” unique addresses for the foreseeable future.

  - Syntax is longer, hexadecimal (e.g. `2001:0db8::1`), but solves exhaustion.


## 3.2 MAC Addresses

  - Burned into the **network interface** at the factory.

  - 12 hexadecimal characters, usually written in pairs with separators:

```text
a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d
```
  - First 6 hex digits: vendor / manufacturer.

  - Last 6 hex digits: device-specific identifier.

Despite being “hardware identifiers”, MAC addresses can be **spoofed**:

  - A device can pretend to have another device’s MAC.

  - If a network trusts MAC addresses too much (e.g. firewall rules or Wi-Fi paywalls by MAC), spoofing can bypass restrictions.

The interactive hotel Wi-Fi lab demonstrates this:

  - Alice has paid → her MAC is allowed.

  - Bob has not paid → his packets are dropped.

  - If Bob changes his MAC to match Alice’s, the router can be fooled.

## 4. Ping and ICMP – Basic Connectivity Testing

**Ping** is one of the simplest and most useful network tools.

  - It uses **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** echo requests and echo replies.

  - Measures:

    - Whether a host is reachable.

    - Round-trip time (latency) between the two devices.

Example usage:
```bash
ping 8.8.8.8
ping example.com
```
Typical output shows:

  - Packets sent vs packets received.

  - Loss percentage.

  - Minimum / average / maximum round-trip time.

Use cases:

  - Check whether a host is online.

  - Roughly diagnose latency or packet loss.

  - Quick connectivity test before deeper troubleshooting.

In the room’s mini-lab, pinging `8.8.8.8` on the provided website reveals a flag confirming success.

## 5. Checklist: Mental Model for Basic Networking

When thinking about a simple network scenario, I can walk through:

  - **Who is connected to whom?**
 
    - What devices are on the same private network?

    - Where is the boundary to the public Internet?
      
  - **How are devices identified?**

    - IP address (logical) – public vs private.

    - MAC address (hardware) – can it be trusted or spoofed?
   
  - **Is connectivity working?**

    - Use `ping` (ICMP) to test reachability and latency.

    - If ping fails: check IP, routing, firewall, or physical connection.

  - **What version of IP is used?**

    - IPv4 addressing and limitations.

    - IPv6 addresses beginning to appear in modern networks.

This model is enough to reason about many beginner-level network and security tasks.
