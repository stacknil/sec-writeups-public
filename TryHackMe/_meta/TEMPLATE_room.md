## Quick use

1. Fill front matter with canonical values from `TryHackMe/_meta/TAGS.md`.
2. Use public-safe placeholders such as `TARGET_IP`, `USER_A`, `example.com`, and `API_KEY_REDACTED`.
3. Prefer reusable patterns and reasoning over raw command history.
4. Run `SANITIZATION_CHECKLIST.md` before publishing the note.
