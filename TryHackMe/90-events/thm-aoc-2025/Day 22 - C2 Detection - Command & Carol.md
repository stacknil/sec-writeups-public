# HTA Malware Analysis Notes — AoC 2025 Day 21 (survey.hta)

## Summary

* **HTA (HTML Application)** runs on Windows via **mshta.exe (Microsoft HTML Application Host)**. It behaves like a lightweight desktop app built from HTML + script.
* Malicious HTA is commonly used as an **initial-access launcher / downloader**: lure UI + script logic → fetch remote content → **execute in memory** → optional **exfiltration**.
* The analyzed artifact (`survey.hta`) is a **survey-themed lure** that downloads “questions” from a look‑alike domain, exfiltrates host identifiers, then executes downloaded content after de‑obfuscation.

## Key Concepts

* **Signed Binary Proxy Execution（签名二进制代理执行）**: abuse of legitimate signed binaries (e.g., `mshta.exe`) to run attacker-controlled code.
* **LOLBins（借刀系统工具）**: built-in tools frequently abused (e.g., `mshta.exe`, `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`).
* **Obfuscation（混淆）**: Base64 and simple substitution ciphers (e.g., ROT13) used to hide URLs/payloads.
* **Exfiltration（外传）**: sending system identifiers outward to attacker infrastructure.

## Artifact Anatomy (What to Look For)

### 1) Application metadata

Typical location: `<head>` with `<title>` and `<HTA:APPLICATION ...>`.

* Example fields that matter:

  * `title`: social-engineering label shown to the user.
  * `APPLICATIONNAME`, `ID`: can reveal intent or imitate a legitimate tool.
  * UI controls: `WINDOWSTATE`, `SHOWINTASKBAR`, etc. (stealthy HTAs often minimize/hide).

### 2) Script sections

Common script types:

* `text/vbscript` (often used for Windows automation + process spawning)
* `text/javascript` (often used for UI + logic glue)

High-signal patterns:

* `CreateObject(...)` usage
* `Run`, `Execute`, `ExecuteGlobal`, `Eval` (execution sinks)
* Embedded encoded strings (Base64 blocks, odd char shifts)

## Observed Behavior (survey.hta)

### A) Lure/UI behavior

* Appears as a legitimate developer/salary survey.
* Uses simple UI functions (e.g., show/hide elements, spinner, “thanks” screen) to look authentic.

### B) “Questions” download (pretends to be benign)

* A function named like `getQuestions()` behaves like a **content fetcher**.
* A hidden browser object (e.g., `InternetExplorer.Application`) is used as a **built-in HTTP client**.
* Download source is a **typosquatted domain** (look-alike), designed to blend in.

### C) Host enumeration + exfiltration

* Uses `WScript.Network` to obtain identifiers commonly including:

  * `ComputerName`
  * `UserName`
* Sends the collected values to an attacker endpoint (example: `/details`) via **HTTP GET** (data placed in query string).

### D) Remote content execution (the real problem)

* The fetched “questions” content is not only displayed; it is **executed**.
* Typical execution sinks in HTA:

  * `Execute` / `ExecuteGlobal` (VBScript)
  * `WScript.Shell.Run` (spawns PowerShell)

**Execution chain conceptually**:

1. Download remote blob
2. Decode/deobfuscate
3. Pass decoded text to an execution sink

## Obfuscation Chain (as seen in the lab workflow)

### Layer 1 — Base64

* Base64 often hides:

  * URLs (C2 / staging)
  * Secondary script blocks
* Practical check:

  * Decode and inspect whether output looks like a URL, script, or more encoded text.

### Layer 2 — ROT13 (simple substitution)

* When code shifts letters by a fixed rotation (A↔N), it is typically **ROT13**.
* ROT13 is not cryptography; it is **cheap concealment**.

### Layer 3 — In-memory execution

* Decoded content may be executed as a PowerShell scriptblock or VBScript execution.

## Indicators (IOCs) — Sanitized

* Process:

  * `mshta.exe` launching script execution
* Network:

  * `survey.<lookalike-domain>` (questions source)
  * `raw.king-malhare[.]com/.../REDACTED.txt` (example staging URL shown after Base64 decode)
  * Exfil endpoint example: `/details`

> Note: In real incidents, preserve full IOCs in a private IR workspace; publish sanitized forms only.

## Quick Static Analysis Workflow (Repeatable)

1. **Do not execute** the `.hta`.
2. Open in a text editor.
3. Identify:

   * `<title>` and `<HTA:APPLICATION ...>` metadata
   * script blocks (`vbscript` / `javascript`)
4. List functions and locate entry points:

   * `window_onLoad`, `onLoad`, auto-run triggers
5. Trace network primitives:

   * `InternetExplorer.Application`, `XMLHTTP`, `WinHttpRequest`, `ADODB.Stream`
6. Extract encoded blobs:

   * Base64 strings → decode
   * detect substitution loops → ROT13
7. Locate execution sinks:

   * `Execute`, `ExecuteGlobal`, `Run`, `Eval`
8. Summarize:

   * what is fetched, what is exfiltrated, what is executed

## Detection Ideas (Practical)

### Endpoint telemetry

* Alert on:

  * `mshta.exe` spawned by email clients (e.g., Outlook) or browsers
  * `mshta.exe` spawning `powershell.exe`, `wscript.exe`, `cmd.exe`
  * command lines containing `FromBase64String`, long Base64 blobs

### Network telemetry

* Look for:

  * new/rare domains with subtle typos
  * GET requests to unusual endpoints (e.g., `/details`) containing host identifiers

## Mitigations

* Reduce `mshta.exe` exposure:

  * application control (WDAC/AppLocker)
  * block/limit `mshta.exe` where feasible
* Email hardening:

  * quarantine `.hta` attachments
  * enforce Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) + SmartScreen policies
* Script control:

  * tighten PowerShell policy, logging (ScriptBlock logging)
* User-facing controls:

  * treat “survey / verification / captcha” attachments as high-risk

## Lab Q&A Snapshot (Based on the visible artifact/workflow)

* HTA title: **Best Festival Company Developer Survey**
* VBScript function that downloads questions: **getQuestions()**
* Typosquatting giveaway: **an extra “i” in “festival” (festiival)**
* Survey question count (UI): **4**
* Prize lure destination: **South Pole**
* Exfiltrated host fields: **ComputerName, UserName**
* Exfil endpoint example: **/details**
* Exfil HTTP method: **GET**
* Encoded scheme used to hide the download: **Base64**
* Additional concealment: **ROT13**

> Items that require the full HTA payload (e.g., exact execution line and final flag) depend on the exact lab file contents and are not inferred here.

## Pitfalls

* “Looks like content” ≠ “only content”: downloaded text may be executed.
* `InternetExplorer.Application` as HTTP client can evade simplistic “no curl/no powershell download” assumptions.
* Base64 decode output may still be obfuscated; a second (or third) step is common.

## Takeaways

* HTA is a UI + scripting container; the UI is distraction, the script is the weapon.
* Fast triage equals: **entry point → network call → decode → execution sink**.
* Simple obfuscation (Base64/ROT13) is enough to evade casual inspection; decoding should be routine.
