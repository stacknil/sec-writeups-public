# Windows Registry Forensics Notes — Dispatch-SRV01 (TryHackMe AoC)

## Summary

Windows Registry is a hierarchical configuration database (keys/values) backing OS + user settings. In DFIR, registry artifacts help answer **what changed**, **what executed**, **what persisted**, and **who did it**—often when file system traces are partial.

This note focuses on:

* Registry *hives* vs *root keys*
* Offline analysis with **Registry Explorer**
* A practical pivot workflow to identify **install → execution → persistence**

---

## Key Concepts

### 1) Hives vs Root Keys

* **Hive (file on disk)**: binary data store (e.g., `SYSTEM`, `SOFTWARE`, `NTUSER.DAT`).
* **Root key (logical view)**: what Registry Editor shows (e.g., `HKLM`, `HKCU`).

**Mapping (high-signal subset):**

```text
Disk Hive  → Registry View
SYSTEM     → HKLM\SYSTEM
SOFTWARE   → HKLM\SOFTWARE
SECURITY   → HKLM\SECURITY
SAM        → HKLM\SAM
NTUSER.DAT → HKU\<SID>  and HKCU
USRCLASS.DAT → HKU\<SID>\Software\Classes
```

### 2) Control Sets (why `CurrentControlSet` is tricky offline)

* Live Windows often uses `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet` as an alias.
* Offline hive viewers usually expose **`ControlSet00x`** (e.g., `ControlSet001`).
* For hostname, a typical offline path:

```text
ROOT\ControlSet001\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName
```

### 3) “Dirty” hives & transaction logs

Live acquisitions can be **dirty** (incomplete transactions). Use transaction logs (`*.LOG`, `*.LOG1`, `*.LOG2`) to replay and reach a consistent state.

## Tools

### Registry Editor (live)

Good for quick checks on a running host, but **not** ideal for forensic analysis (risk of modification, limited offline handling).

### Registry Explorer (offline)

* Loads hive files directly.
* Parses binary value data.
* Supports searching, bookmarks, timestamps, and deleted records (depending on artifact/tool).

**Operational tip:** when loading a hive, use the “SHIFT + Open” pattern (or the tool’s equivalent) to replay transaction logs.

## Registry Artifacts Cheat Sheet (DFIR)

Think of these as “sensors” for user behavior + system configuration.

| Artifact                    | Typical Path (logical)                                           | What it answers                                         |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Hostname                    | `HKLM\SYSTEM\...\ComputerName\ComputerName`                      | Which machine is this?                                  |
| USB history                 | `HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USBSTOR`                     | What removable devices were attached?                   |
| Run dialog MRU              | `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU` | What commands were typed in Win+R?                      |
| UserAssist                  | `HKCU\...\Explorer\UserAssist`                                   | GUI-launched apps (weak execution evidence, but useful) |
| TypedPaths                  | `HKCU\...\Explorer\TypedPaths`                                   | Paths typed in Explorer address bar                     |
| WordWheelQuery              | `HKCU\...\Explorer\WordWheelQuery`                               | Explorer search terms                                   |
| Installed programs          | `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`       | What was installed (and when)?                          |
| Startup persistence         | `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`             | What auto-starts at logon?                              |
| AppCompat execution (paths) | `HKCU\...\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Store`          | Full executable paths the user ran                      |

## Practical Workflow: Install → Execute → Persist

Use this as a repeatable playbook (Te/Te-style: deterministic pivots).

### Step 0 — Establish the incident boundary

* Record the **known abnormal start time** (here: **2025-10-21**).
* Anything before that is “pre-positioning” candidate.

### Step 1 — Identify the host (sanity check)

* Load **SYSTEM** hive.
* Navigate to:

```text
ROOT\ControlSet001\Control\ComputerName\ComputerName
```

Confirm the hostname matches your case target.

### Step 2 — Find suspicious install (SOFTWARE hive)

* Load **SOFTWARE** hive.
* Pivot into:

```text
ROOT\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall
```

Sort by LastWrite timestamp and look for entries just before the abnormal window.

### Step 3 — Confirm user execution path (NTUSER.DAT)

Install evidence ≠ executed. Confirm a *user ran it*:

```text
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\Compatibility Assistant\Store
```

This often records **full executable paths** that were actually launched.

### Step 4 — Find persistence (SOFTWARE hive)

Attackers (or shady installers) often set logon persistence here:

```text
HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
```

Look for new values pointing to unusual binaries (or unusual arguments like `/background`, `-silent`, etc.).

## Case Findings (from the lab walkthrough)

> Treat these as the lab’s ground truth for this scenario.

1. **Installed application (pre-abnormal window):**

* `Drone Manager Updater`

2. **Full path where the user launched it from:**

* `C:\Users\dispatch.admin\Downloads\DroneManagerSetup.exe`

3. **Persistence value added on startup:**

* Key: `HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`
* Value name: `DroneHelper`
* Data (example): `"C:\Program Files\Drone Manager\DroneHelper.exe" /background`

---

## Pitfalls / Common Mistakes

* **ControlSet confusion:** offline views show `ControlSet001/002`, not always `CurrentControlSet`.
* **Per-user artifacts require SID:** `HKU\<SID>` matters; `HKCU` is a convenience alias.
* **Install ≠ execution:** confirm execution via AppCompat/UserAssist/RunMRU, not only Uninstall.
* **Timestamps are not “execution time”:** many LastWrite times reflect configuration writes, not process start.
* **Dirty hive loading:** skipping log replay can hide (or mis-time) critical entries.
