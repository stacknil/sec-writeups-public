# Logs Fundamentals

## Summary

Logs are the primary trace source in most digital investigations. They record normal activity, errors, administrative actions, and malicious behavior. In practice, logs are useful for five core goals:

* security monitoring and anomaly detection
* incident investigation and root cause analysis
* troubleshooting system or application issues
* performance observation
* auditing and compliance

A useful mental model is simple: **logs are digital footprints**. They rarely tell the full story on their own, but when correlated across systems, they reconstruct attack paths, user actions, and system state changes.

---

## Why Logs Matter

In a physical investigation, responders look for footprints, forced entry, camera footage, and damaged objects. In a digital investigation, the equivalent evidence often lives in logs.

Typical value of logs:

* **What happened?**
* **When did it happen?**
* **Who or what triggered it?**
* **Which asset was involved?**
* **What happened next?**

This is why logging quality directly affects detection quality and forensic depth.

## Core Log Categories

Different logs answer different questions. Separating them by function reduces noise during investigation.

| Log type | Main purpose | Typical examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System Logs | OS and platform operations | startup, shutdown, drivers, hardware faults, service issues |
| Security Logs | Security-relevant activity | authentication, authorization, account changes, policy changes |
| Application Logs | App-specific behavior | user interactions, app errors, updates, internal actions |
| Audit Logs | Accountability and traceability | data access, admin changes, policy enforcement |
| Network Logs | Traffic visibility | inbound/outbound connections, firewall events, sessions |
| Access Logs | Access to resources | web access, database access, API requests |

### Quick Distinction

* **Network logs** answer: *what moved across the wire?*
* **Security logs** answer: *who authenticated, changed, failed, or escalated?*
* **Application logs** answer: *what did the app do internally?*
* **Access logs** answer: *who requested which resource, when, and how?*

## Log Analysis: Basic Workflow

Manual log analysis is still valuable, especially in labs, scoping, validation, or small investigations.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Define the question] --> B[Pick the right log type]
    B --> C[Filter by time / event / IP / user]
    C --> D[Extract relevant records]
    D --> E[Correlate across sources]
    E --> F[Build timeline]
    F --> G[Answer investigation question]
```

### Practical Investigation Logic

1. Start with a narrow question.
2. Choose the correct log source.
3. Filter aggressively.
4. Validate timestamps and identities.
5. Correlate with surrounding events.
6. Convert observations into a timeline.

### Common Pivots

* timestamp
* user account
* source IP
* hostname
* process name
* URL or path
* event ID
* HTTP method / status code

## Windows Event Logs

Windows stores many activities in structured event logs. For investigations, three channels matter first:

* **Application**
* **System**
* **Security**

The most important from a security perspective is usually **Security** because it records authentication and account-management activity.

### Event Viewer

Windows provides a built-in GUI tool for inspection: **Event Viewer**.

Typical workflow:

1. Open `Event Viewer`
2. Go to `Windows Logs`
3. Select `Security`, `System`, or `Application`
4. Use **Filter Current Log**
5. Filter by **Event ID**, time range, or keywords
6. Open specific events for details

### Important Fields in a Windows Event

* **Description** - detailed event text
* **Log Name** - which channel the event belongs to
* **Logged** - timestamp
* **Event ID** - numeric identifier for the activity type

### High-Value Event IDs

| Event ID | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 4624 | Successful logon |
| 4625 | Failed logon |
| 4634 | Successful logoff |
| 4720 | User account created |
| 4722 | User account enabled |
| 4724 | Password reset attempt |
| 4725 | User account disabled |
| 4726 | User account deleted |

### Investigation Example

If the question is *"Which account was created before the compromise?"*, filtering for **4720** is more efficient than scrolling through all security events.

If the question is *"Was the created account later enabled?"*, pivot next to **4722**.

If the question is *"Was its password reset?"*, pivot to **4724**.

### Investigation Pattern for Account Abuse

```text
4720  -> account created
4722  -> account enabled
4724  -> password reset attempted
4624  -> successful logon using that account
4634  -> logoff
```

This sequence is often more valuable than any single event in isolation.

---

## Windows Event Log Analysis Tips

### Useful Questions

* Which account was created last?
* Which parent account created it?
* When was the account enabled?
* Was the password reset afterward?
* Did the account log in successfully later?

### Practical Method

* Filter `Security` log by `4720`
* Identify the suspicious created account
* Open the event to inspect the **actor** who created it
* Filter `4722` for the same account
* Filter `4724` for password reset attempts
* Filter `4624` for successful use of the account

### Common Mistakes

* confusing the **target account** with the **actor account**
* ignoring time ordering
* using only one event instead of validating the chain
* forgetting that administrative bulk actions may be benign

## Web Server Access Logs

Web access logs record HTTP requests made to a web server. These logs are crucial for both troubleshooting and security investigation.

### Typical Fields in an Apache Access Log

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| IP Address | client/source IP |
| Timestamp | time of request |
| HTTP Method | GET, POST, etc. |
| URL | requested path/resource |
| Status Code | server response status |
| User-Agent | browser / OS / client fingerprint |

### Example Interpretation

```text
CLIENT_IP - - [06/Jun/2024:13:58:44] "GET /products HTTP/1.1" 404 "-" "Mozilla/..."
```

This tells us:

* source IP: `CLIENT_IP`
* time: `06/Jun/2024:13:58:44`
* method: `GET`
* path: `/products`
* protocol: `HTTP/1.1`
* response: `404`
* client fingerprint: browser/user-agent string

### Why Access Logs Matter

They help answer questions like:

* which IP last requested `/contact`?
* when did a suspect IP make a POST request?
* which URL received the suspicious POST?
* did the activity resemble brute force, enumeration, or exploitation?

## Manual Web Log Analysis Commands

### `cat`

Show file contents.

```bash
cat access.log
```

Also useful for combining rotated logs:

```bash
cat access1.log access2.log > combined_access.log
```

### `grep`

Search for strings or patterns.

```bash
grep "CLIENT_IP" access.log
grep '"GET /contact' access.log
grep '"POST' access.log
```

### `less`

Browse large logs page by page.

```bash
less access.log
```

Inside `less`:

* `Space` -> next page
* `b` -> previous page
* `/pattern` -> search
* `n` -> next match
* `N` -> previous match

### Useful Combinations

```bash
grep '"GET /contact' access.log | tail
```

```bash
grep 'CLIENT_IP' access.log | grep '"POST'
```

```bash
grep 'CLIENT_IP' access.log | tail -n 20
```

These are often enough for lab-scale investigations.

## Web Access Log Investigation Pattern

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Identify question] --> B[Filter by method or URL]
    B --> C[Filter by IP if needed]
    C --> D[Sort or inspect latest matching entries]
    D --> E[Extract timestamp / path / status]
    E --> F[Build request sequence]
```

### Example Questions

* What is the IP that made the last `GET /contact` request?
* When was the last `POST` by `CLIENT_IP`?
* Which URL received that final POST?

### Reasoning Pattern

1. Find matching lines.
2. Move to the latest occurrence.
3. Extract the relevant field.
4. Validate adjacent lines if the attack is multi-step.

---

## Status Codes: Fast Interpretation

| Status | Meaning | Investigation value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 200 | OK | request succeeded |
| 301/302 | Redirect | may indicate login flow or URL rewrite |
| 403 | Forbidden | probing or blocked access |
| 404 | Not Found | enumeration, recon, broken links |
| 500 | Server Error | app bug, exploit side effect, backend issue |

A high volume of `404` across many paths may indicate content discovery or forced browsing.

---

## Investigation Heuristics

### In Windows Logs

Look for:

* account creation followed by enablement
* unexpected password reset activity
* successful logons after repeated failures
* admin action chains outside normal hours

### In Web Access Logs

Look for:

* unusual POST requests
* repeated requests from one IP to many paths
* admin or auth endpoints accessed repeatedly
* suspicious user-agents
* bursts of `404`, `403`, or `500`

### Cross-Source Correlation

A single log line is weak evidence. Correlation is stronger.

Examples:

* web access log shows POST to admin endpoint
* application log shows internal error afterward
* security log shows account created minutes later
* network log shows outbound session to a rare IP

That is how investigations become explanations, not guesses.

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Reading Everything Instead of Filtering

Logs are large. Start with the question, not the file.

### 2. Ignoring Timestamps

If the time sequence is wrong, the story is wrong.

### 3. Confusing Cause and Effect

A `500` error may be caused by exploitation, misconfiguration, or routine breakage. Context decides.

### 4. Treating One Event as Proof

One event is a clue. Multiple corroborating records form evidence.

### 5. Ignoring Benign Admin Activity

Not every account creation or failed logon is malicious.

### 6. Forgetting Rotation and Fragmentation

The event you need may live in another log file or previous rotation.

Question  ->  Filter  ->  Correlate

If you skip Question:
  you drown in noise.
If you skip Filter:
  you waste time.
If you skip Correlate:
  you misread the event.

* Different log types answer different investigative questions.
* Windows Event Logs become far more usable once you pivot by **Event ID**.
* Web access logs are highly effective for reconstructing request sequences.
* Manual analysis with `cat`, `grep`, and `less` is basic but still operationally useful.
* The value of a log is rarely in one line; it is in **context, sequence, and correlation**.
